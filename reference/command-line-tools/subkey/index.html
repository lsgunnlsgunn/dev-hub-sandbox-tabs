                <h1 id="subkey">subkey</h1>
<p>The <code>subkey</code> program is a key generation and management utility that is included in the Substrate repository.
You can use the <code>subkey</code> program to perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate and inspect cryptographically-secure public and private key pairs.</li>
<li>Restore keys from secret phrases and raw seeds.</li>
<li>Sign and verify signatures on messages.</li>
<li>Sign and verify signatures for encoded transactions.</li>
<li>Derive hierarchical deterministic child key pairs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="signature-schemes">Signature schemes</h2>
<p>The <code>subkey</code> program currently supporting the following signature schemes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-cryptography">sr25519</a>: Schorr signatures on the Ristretto group.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519">ed25519</a>: SHA-512 (SHA-2) on Curve25519.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1">secp256k1</a>: ECDSA signatures on secp256k1.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Substrate-based networks, the <code>sr25519</code> encoded keys are used to produce
<a href="">SS58 addresses</a> as the public keys for interacting with the blockchain.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>You can download, install, an compile <code>subkey</code> using <code>cargo</code> without cloning the full Substrate repository.
However, you must add Substrate build dependencies to your environment before you can install <code>subkey</code> as a standalone binary.
To ensure dependencies are available, you can build the <code>subkey</code> binary from a clone of the Substrate repository.</p>
<p>To install and compile the <code>subkey</code> program:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open a terminal shell, if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify that you have the Rust compiler and toolchain, if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clone the Substrate repository, if necessary, by running the following command:</p>
<p><code>bash
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change to the root directory of the Substrate repository by running the following command:</p>
<p><code>bash
cd substrate</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compile the <code>subkey</code> program using the <code>nightly</code> toolchain by running the following command:</p>
<p><code>bash
cargo +nightly build --package subkey --release</code></p>
<p>Because of the number of packages involved, compiling the node can take several minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify that your node is ready to use and information about the options available by running the following command:</p>
<p><code>bash
./target/release/subkey --help</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="hierarchical-deterministic-keys">Hierarchical deterministic keys</h2>
<p>The <code>subkey</code> program supports hierarchical deterministic keys.
Hierarchical deterministic (HD) keys enable you to use a parent seed to derive child key pairs in a hierarchical tree structure. 
In this hierarchical structure, each child derived from a parent has its own key pair.
The derived keys can also be used to derive additional child key pairs, similar to how a file system can have nested directories in a hierarchical directory structure.
For background information about how hierarchical deterministic keys are derived, see the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki">BIP32</a> specification for hierarchical deterministic wallets.</p>
<p>For information about deriving hierarchical deterministic keys using subkey commands, see <a href="#derived-keys">Working with derived keys</a>.</p>
<h2 id="basic-command-usage">Basic command usage</h2>
<p>The basic syntax for running <code>subkey</code> commands is:</p>
<pre><code>subkey [subcommand] [flag]
</code></pre>
<p>Depending on the subcommand you specify, additional arguments, options, and flags might apply or be required. 
To view usage information for a specific <code>subkey</code> subcommand, specify the subcommand and the <code>--help</code> flag. 
For example, to see usage information for <code>subkey inspect</code>, you can run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>subkey inspect --help
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>subkey</code> program encodes the address associated with a public/private key pair differently depending on the format required for the network where it is used. 
If you want to use the <strong>same private key</strong> on the Kusama and Polkadot networks, you can use the <code>--network</code> option to generate the separate address formats for the Kusama and Polkadot networks. 
The public key is the same, but the address formats are network-specific.
To generate a key pair for a specific network, run a command similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">subkey generate --network picasso
</code></pre>
<p>The command displays the same fields as output, but uses the address format for the network you specify.</p>
<p>To generate a more secure key pair that uses the <code>ed25519</code> signature scheme and an 24-word secret phrase for the <code>moonriver</code> network, you would run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">subkey generate --scheme ed25519 --words 24 --network moonriver 
</code></pre>
<p>The command displays the same fields as output, but uses the Ed25519 signature scheme, a 24-word secret phrase, and the address format for the <code>moonriver</code> network.</p>

<p>To generate a key that is password-protected, run the <code>subkey generate</code> command using the <code>--password &lt;password&gt;</code> option.
For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">subkey generate --password &quot;pencil laptop kitchen cutter&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>After you generate a key that requires a password, you can retrieve it by including the <code>--password</code> option and password string in the command line or by adding three slashes (<code>///</code>) at the end of the secret phrase.
Remember that it is important to keep passwords, secret phrases, and secret seeds secure and to back them up in a secure location.</p>
<h2 id="subkey-generate-node-key">subkey generate-node-key</h2>
<p>Use the <code>subkey generate-node-key</code> command to generate random public and private keys for peer-to-peer (<code>libp2p</code>) communication between Substrate nodes.
The public key is the peer identifier that is used in chain specification files or as a command-line argument to identify a node participating in the blockchain network.
In most cases, you use run this command with a command-line option to save the private key to a file.</p>

<p>The <code>subkey</code> program encodes the address associated with a public/private key pair differently depending on the format required for the network where it is used. 
If you use the <strong>same private key</strong> on the Kusama and Polkadot networks, you can use the <code>--network</code> option to inspect the address used for a specific network. 
The public key is the same, but the address format is network-specific.
To inspect a key pair for a specific network, run a command similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">subkey inspect --network kusama &quot;caution juice atom organ advance problem want pledge someone senior holiday very&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>In the command output, the secret phrase, secret seed, and public keys are the same, but the address for the Kusama network is:</p>
<pre><code>  SS58 Address:      HRkCrbmke2XeabJ5fxJdgXWpBRPkXWfWHY8eTeCKwDdf4k6
</code></pre>
<p>To inspect the address for the same private key on the Polkadot network, you would run a command similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">subkey inspect --network polkadot &quot;caution juice atom organ advance problem want pledge someone senior holiday very&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>In the command output, the secret phrase, secret seed, and public keys are the same as the Kusama network, but the address for the Polkadot network is:</p>

<h2 id="working-with-derived-keys">Working with derived keys<a name="derived-keys"></a></h2>
<p>In Substrate, hierarchical deterministic derived keys are classified as hard keys or as soft keys based on how they are derived.
For example, hard keys can only be derived using the parent <strong>private key</strong> and a derivation path.
The parent public key cannot be used to derive a hard key.</p>
<p>Soft keys can be derived using either the parent private key or the parent <strong>public key</strong> and a derivation path.
Because soft keys can be derived using the parent public key, they can be used to identify the parent key without exposing the parent seed. 
You can derive either hard keys or soft keys by using different syntax in <code>subkey</code> commands.
You can then use the addresses associated with derived keys to sign messages with the same security as messages signed by their root key.</p>
<h3 id="derive-a-hard-key">Derive a hard key</h3>
<p>To derive a hard child key pair, you add two slashes (<code>//</code>), a derivation path, and an index after the secret phrase associated with its parent key.
Because you derive child key pairs and addresses from keys that have been previously generated, you use the <code>subkey inspect</code> command.
For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">subkey inspect &quot;caution juice atom organ advance problem want pledge someone senior holiday very//derived-hard-key//0&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The command displays output similar to the following:</p>

<h3 id="derive-a-soft-key">Derive a soft key</h3>
<p>To derive a soft child key pair from a parent private key, you add one slash (<code>/</code>), a derivation path, and an index after the secret phrase associated with the parent key.
Because you are deriving a new key pair and address from a key that ahs been previously generated, you use the <code>subkey inspect</code> command.
For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">subkey inspect &quot;caution juice atom organ advance problem want pledge someone senior holiday very/derived-soft-key/0&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>To derive a soft child key pair from a parent public key, you can use the public SS58 address instead of the secret phrase. 
Because you are deriving a soft key, you use a single slash (<code>/</code>) to delimit the derivation path and index fields.
For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">subkey inspect &quot;5Gv8YYFu8H1btvmrJy9FjjAWfb99wrhV3uhPFoNEr918utyR/derived-public/0&quot;

<p>If you use the same derivation path and index, the soft child key is the same whether you use the parent private key or parent public address.
If you change either the derivation path—for example, from <code>derived-soft-key</code> to <code>derived-public</code>—or the index—from <code>0</code> to <code>1</code>—you derive different child keys with different addresses.

<p>Note that the secret seed <em>is not</em> password protected. 
Although it can still recover <em>an</em> account, the key pair that's derived <em>is not the same</em> account as recovered with <em>any</em> password!
The same seed with different derivation paths passwords will derive different keys.
The secret phrase is not sufficient to recover a key pair.
Keep your paths and passwords secure, as without it your key pair cannot be recovered!</p>
<p>You can derive a soft key as a child of a hard key. 
Doing so enables you to use the public address of the derived hard—with an optional password—to derive new public addresses.
For example, the following command derives a hard key (<code>//derived-hard-key</code>) with a soft key leaf (<code>/0</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">subkey inspect &quot;caution juice atom organ advance problem want pledge someone senior holiday very//derived-hard-key/0&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The command displays output similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Secret Key URI `caution juice atom organ advance problem want pledge someone senior holiday very//derived-hard-key/0` is account:
  Secret seed:       n/a
  Public key (hex):  0x525039c770a07a38d8dc066927ad1f0d2b2113f4bc890c4fd39a37d477d0d336

  Public key (SS58): 5DvdcfXQe2QcWHNZrUR5Bb2AJQ199BiNH5aHefE4kXSRP1VR
  SS58 Address:      5DvdcfXQe2QcWHNZrUR5Bb2AJQ199BiNH5aHefE4kXSRP1VR
</code></pre>
<p>To protect the derived hard key, you can add your password to the end of the secret phrase:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">subkey inspect &quot;caution juice atom organ advance problem want pledge someone senior holiday very//derived-hard-key/0///pencil laptop kitchen cutter&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The command displays output similar to the following:</p>

<p>The following command creates a soft key derived from a public address with a hidden seed, hard key derivation path, and a password.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">subkey inspect &quot;5GsbzysSK8TKahXBC7FpS2myx3nWehMyYU7q8CLrzZCjpKbM/0&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The command displays output similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Public Key URI `5GsbzysSK8TKahXBC7FpS2myx3nWehMyYU7q8CLrzZCjpKbM/0` is account:
  Network ID/version: substrate
  Public key (hex):   0xcaf1f5ec14b507b5c365c6528cc06de74a5615274694a0c895ed4109c0ff0d32
  Public key (SS58):  5GeoQa3nkeNmzZSfgBFuK3BkAggnTHcX3S1j94sffJYYphrP

<p>This example illustrates that the soft key derived using the <em>SS58-address/derivation path</em> produces the same address as the <em>secret phrase//derivation path/index///password</em>. With this strategy for combining hard and soft keys, you can reveal a parent public address and soft derivation paths without revealing your secret phrase or password, retaining control of all derived addresses.</p>
<h3 id="predefined-accounts-and-keys">Predefined accounts and keys</h3>
<p>Substrate includes several predefined accounts that you can use for testing in a local development environment.
These predefined accounts are all derived from the same seed using a single secret phrase.
The secret phrase used to generate the keys for all of the predefined accounts consists of the following words:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk
</code></pre>
<p>You can inspect the keys for the predefined account using the derivation path.
For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">subkey inspect //Alice
</code></pre>
<p>The command </p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Secret Key URI `//Alice` is account:
  Secret seed:       0xe5be9a5092b81bca64be81d212e7f2f9eba183bb7a90954f7b76361f6edb5c0a

  Account ID:        0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d

  SS58 Address:      5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY
</code></pre>
<p>It is important to note that <code>//Alice</code> and <code>//alice</code> are different derivation paths and the secret phrase and derivation path for the predefined account is actually:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk//Alice
</code></pre>
<p>You can run the following command to verify the keys match:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">subkey inspect &quot;bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk//Alice&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The command output displays the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Secret Key URI `bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk//Alice` is account:
